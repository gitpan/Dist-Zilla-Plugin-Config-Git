DESCRIPTION
    This is a configuration plugin for Git repo/branch information. A
    configuration plugin is sort of like a Stash, but is better suited for
    intra-plugin data sharing, using distro (not user) data.

    Why use this? To provide a standard set of information to other Git
    plugins easily, especially if the repo data is non-standard, or if you
    need more than one set of data.

OPTIONS
  remote
    Name of the remote repo, in standard Git repo format (refspec or git
    URL).

    Default is "origin".

  local_branch
    Name of the local branch name.

    Default is "master".

  remote_branch
    Name of the remote branch name.

    Default is "master".

  allow_dirty
    Filenames of files in the local repo that are allowed to have
    modifications prior to a write action, such as a commit. Multiple lines
    are allowed. Any strings in standard "qr" notation are interpreted as
    regular expressions.

    Default is "dist.ini" and whatever changelog is set to.

  changelog
    Name of your change log.

METHODS
  remote_repo_refspec
    Shorthand for "$remote $local_branch:$remote_branch".

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Kent Fredric and Karen Etheridge for implementation discussion.
